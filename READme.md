# Supervised learning project: predicting Boston housing prices


In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

*This project was completed as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.*



**Toolkit**: Python, Sci-kit learn, Seaborn, Decision Tree regression
